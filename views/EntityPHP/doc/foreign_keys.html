<h2><em>One to One/One to Many</em> relationships</h2>
<p>
	With <b>EntityPHP</b>, <em>One to One</em> and <em>One to Many</em> relationships are handled in the same way. We just
	need to define this relationship on only one of related classes.
</p>
<p>
	Let's start for a <em>One to One</em> example. We have an <em>Users</em> class and a <em>Passport</em> class: an user
	can have only one passport, a passport can belong to only one user. In order to create this relationship, you have to
	define it either on the <em>Users</em> class or on the <em>Passport</em> one. It's up to you!
</p>
<p>
	Concerning <em>One to Many</em> relationships, we must define it on the <em>One</em> side. For example, we can have an
	<em>Authors</em> class and an <em>Articles</em> class: an article is written by one author, but an author can write many articles.
	In this case, the relationship must be define on the <em>Articles</em> class.
</p>
<p>
	So, how to define this relationship? Simply by adding a new property to the corresponding class:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">class Articles extends \EntityPHP\Entity
{
	protected $title;
	protected $content;
	protected $author;

	public static function __structure()
	{
		return array(
			'title'		=>	'VARCHAR(255)',
			'content'	=>	'TEXT',
			//Instead of SQL type, we use the related class name
			//(we admit that Authors is an existed class inherited from EntityPHP\Entity)
			'author'	=>	'Authors',
		);
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
	Below is the structure and indexes generated for the table corresponding to this <em>Articles</em> class:
</p>

<h2><em>Many to Many</em> relationships</h2>
<p>
	Let's take a <em>Languages</em> class and a <em>Developers</em> class: a language is used by many developers and a
	developer can use many languages: it's a typical case of <em>Many to Many</em> relationship!
</p>
<p>
	This kind of relationships are handled in a very similar way with <b>EntityPHP</b>. We still need to define it
	on only one class. Like <em>One to One</em> relationships, the choice is up to you!
</p>
<p>
	The only difference with previous relationships is that we define it by using an array instead of a string:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">class Developers extends \EntityPHP\Entity
{
	protected $firstname;
	protected $lastname;
	protected $languages;

	//__structure() method is mandatory and must return an array
	public static function __structure()
	{
		return array(
			'firstname'	=>	'VARCHAR(255)',
			'lastname'	=>	'VARCHAR(255)',
			//We want to define a Many to Many relationships, so we
			//use an array with the class name to bind as single value
			'languages'	=>	array('Languages'),
		);
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
	In order to link values between <em>Developers</em> and <em>Languages</em> tables, <b>EntityPHP</b>
	generates a third table:
</p>

<figure>
	<img src="./images/entityphp/tuto_many_to_many_table.png" alt="Structure of generated table" />
</figure>

<p>
	<b>EntityPHP</b> will use this table behind the scene and automatically handle joins requests. In fact, you should
	not be worried about any SQL tables: <b>EntityPHP</b> manages all of them for you!
