		<h2>Upate foreign fields</h2>
	</header>
</div>

<h2><em>One to One/One to Many</em> relationships</h2>
<p>
	Update fields linked with this kind of relation ship is as easy as update a basic property: simply change the
	corresponding property value and call the <code class="language-php">update()</code> method!
</p>
<p>
	Below is an example updating the author of an article:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">//We admit that Authors & Articles classes and their tables exist

//Get the article with id 1
$myArticle	=	Articles::getById(1);

//Check if character is found
if( ! empty($myArticle))
{
	//Get the new author to link to the article
	$myAuthor	=	Authors::getById(2);

	if( ! empty($myAuthor))
	{
		//Update the "author" field of the article
		$myArticle->prop('author', $myAuthor);

		//And save the changes!
		Articles::update($myArticle);
	}
	else
	{
		echo 'The new author of the article is not found.';
	}
}
else
{
	echo 'The article to update is not found.';
}
</code></pre>

<h2><em>Many to Many</em> relationships</h2>

<p>
	Properties binded with <em>Many to Many</em> relationships are lists of objects. Since these lists can be very huge,
	<b>EntityPHP</b> does not load them by default. We need to manually ask the library to load them thanks to the
	<code class="language-php">load()</code> method.
</p>

<p>Once loaded, we can add some objects to this list thanks by using the <code class="language-php">push()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code class="language-php">//We admit that Developers & Languages classes and their tables exist

//Get the developer with id 1
$myDeveloper	=	Developers::getById(1);

//Check if developer is found
if( ! empty($myDeveloper))
{
	//Get language with ID 3
	$myLanguage	=	Languages::getById(3);

	if( ! empty($myLanguage))
	{
		//Load the "languages" properties of the developer
		$languages	=	$myDeveloper->load('languages');

		//Add the new language to this list
		$languages->push($myLanguage);

		//And save the changes!
		Developers::update($myDeveloper);
	}
	else
	{
		echo 'The new language used by the developer is not found.';
	}
}
else
{
	echo 'The developer to update is not found.';
}
</code></pre>

<p>
	The retrieved list can call the method <code class="language-php">push()</code> because it is not a simple array:
	it's an instance of the class <code class="language-php">\EntityPHP\EntityArray</code>. Basically, this class
	is an helper permitting us to manage lists of entities in an easier way than simple arrays. One of its particularities is
	that it forbids storage of instances of different classes: in short, an <em>EntityArray</em> of <em>Developers</em> can
	contain only instances of <em>Developers</em>.
